#  Harpur College Intra-University Transfer or Double Degree

Admissions Office within 5 days of your decision to avoid registration
problems.

###  Deadlines

  * Fall semester: March 15 
  * Late applications will be considered on a space-available basis. 
  * Admission decisions are made after the current semester grades are available. 

###  Decisions

Decisions are emailed by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the end of
each semester to the student's BMail.

  * Admitted students must notify the Admissions Office is they do **not** wish to accept the transfer offer. 
  * Students who are not admitted may apply for admission in a future semester. 

###  Admission requirements

  * Harpur College accepts matriculated students with at least a 2.7 cumulative Binghamton GPA, or who have earned a 3.0 GPA after two semesters of Harpur College coursework and are otherwise in good standing.
