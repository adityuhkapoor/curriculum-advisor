The School of Computing offers the following programs:

  * Two undergraduate degree programs: 
    * BS in Computer Science 
    * BS in Information Systems, Dual-Diploma 
  * Three graduate degree programs: 
    * MS in Computer Science 
    * MS in Information Systems 
    * PhD in Computer Science 
  * One advanced certificate program, in collaboration with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department: 
    * Cybersecurity Advanced Certificate 
  * One micro-credential program: 
    * Artificial Intelligence Micro-Credential 

Undergraduate Computer Science majors at Binghamton become effective,
versatile coders and software developers using the C, C++, Python and Java
programming languages; develop an important foundational understanding of
algorithms, computer architecture, and operating systems; and advance to study
other cutting-edge topics including machine learning, cybersecurity, cloud
computing, data science, mobile computing and more.

Our graduate programs are designed for students interested in pursuing
research studies or careers in computer science and software engineering. Our
curriculum provides students with a solid theoretical and practical
foundation.

The PhD in computer science program was started in Fall 1999, and places a
high priority on conducting transformative research to advance the fields of
computer science and related technical fields. School faculty members,
together with their PhD students, conduct world-class research in a broad
spectrum of computer science areas. The PhD program’s goal is to provide our
graduate students with a firm foundation in computer science fundamentals and
advanced research skills to best prepare them for successful careers in
academia, industry, or other computer science-related fields.
